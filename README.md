# 📵 No Reels Instagram – Distraction-Free Instagram Wrapper App

Tired of losing hours to Instagram Reels? This Flutter app wraps around Instagram’s mobile web and **blocks the Reels section** using injected JavaScript, giving you a focused, distraction-free Instagram experience.

## 🚀 About the Project

Instagram is a powerful platform for staying connected — but the Reels section can be a major distraction. This app provides a cleaner alternative by acting as a **wrapper** for the Instagram mobile site and **automatically blocking Reels** URLs and components.

No rooting, no VPNs — just Flutter, WebView, and a bit of JavaScript magic ✨.
